I like to write, but I always write less than I want to. Even more so with the uprise of LLMs, it feels so weird to write your own sentences.

But nevertheless, I shall continue.

I have many topics I want to write about and that’s one thing that kept me back - should I write about tech? Should I write about deep tech? Should I write proper tutorials? Should I write personal stories?

Should I post on LinkedIn? Medium? Twitter? etc?

Should I write in Romanian or English (the two languages I speak and write in fluently?)

My brain is almost exploding in this tension, so I decided to just write about anything, whatever comes to mind, and let any kind of emergence build itself from the chaos.

I will write long things, short things, in English, in Romanian, about Tech, about cars, and whatever else I fancy.

I recently watched a video from Derek Muller [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xS68sl2D70&ab_channel=PerimeterInstituteforTheoreticalPhysics) where he expresses his worry about his children growing up not knowing how to express themselves due LLMs writing essays for them.

Then I realized that, even though I grew up with writing essays by hand, myself I haven’t done much writing lately.

So I decided to revamp my writing, admit it’s not perfect, and just write about anything (although probably mostly about tech) and see where that goes!
