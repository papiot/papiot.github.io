In most large or small production projects, the Machine Learning is only about 5% of the code, the rest is engineering. This is not based on hard statistics, but rather on intuition.

However, because of the nature of how ML systems work, it changes completely the dynamics of the system.

Data and user interaction flows differently, and the system is self evolving.
